## Flow
iterate data -> directory or file
## Work items
- ✅ determine if an object is a directiory or file by checking whether there's any extension. Cannot use whether there's a children property. Although extention might work in some cases, but it is likely to have false positive because there's no limitation of the directories.
- sort content by categories(dir -> file) first then alphabetically
- ✅ basic rendering
- ✅ click directories to toggle content
- add css
